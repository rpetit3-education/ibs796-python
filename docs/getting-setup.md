In order to begin learning about Python, we'll need to do a few things. For starters, from here on out when I mention *Python* you can assume I'm talking about Python 2.7. In the event I mention *Python 3.5*, I will explicitly state *Python3*. For those interested in the difference between Python 2.7 and Python 3.5, please see the following: [Python 2 or Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3)

# Installing Python

### OSX & Linux

You're in luck! In all likelihood Python is already installed. To confirm this open up a terminal and type *python --version*

```
$ python --version
Python 2.7.11
```

### Windows 10

If you are using Windows 10, you may be in luck. Recently Microsoft has added
native bash support. 

### Windows 7 & 8.1
